### **Keys Pressed:** *`"ssh cs15lfa23qf@ieng6.ucsd.edu"`,  `<enter>`*

Did not have the ieng6 login previously typed, so I could not use the up arrow to access it quickly. I had to type out the login command manually.

## Step 5: Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the SSH URL)

### **Keys Pressed:** *`"git clone"`, `<ctrl + v>`, `<enter>`*

I had the SSH URL copied to my clipboard, so once I had typed out *`"git clone"`*, I could easily paste it in to fill the rest of the command.

## Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

### **Keys Pressed:** *`"sh"`, `<space>`, `"t"`, `<tab>`, `<enter>`*

After typing out *`"sh t"`*, I could press tab to avoid filling in the rest of *`"test.sh"`*.
